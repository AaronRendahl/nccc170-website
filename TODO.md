# To Do

Content here was moved from the README file so that the README mainly contains
how to update content. 
The material below was presented by Jarad Niemi at the NCCC170 Annual Meeting
in 2023. 

## To do

Here are some thoughts about what we should/could do with the NCCC170 website.

### Background

As of summer 2022, there were two main websites for NCCC170:

- [official NIMSS](https://www.nimss.org/projects/view/mrp/outline/18798)
- [Arkansas site](https://nccc170.uark.edu/)

A new site has been created to replace the Arkansas site. 
The new site is hosted by netlify and code is on 
[github](https://github.com/NCCC170/nccc170-website).

- [netlify site](https://nccc170.netlify.app/)
