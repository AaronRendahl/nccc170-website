      General objectives of [NCCC170](https://www.nimss.org/projects/18798):
      
      1. To identify, foster and coordinate cooperative research efforts in statistics among statisticians serving food and agriculture research programs.
      2. To explore current and anticipated statistical problems in food and agriculture research and seek solutions to these problems.
      3. To provide continuing statistical education to the scientific community through workshops and short courses, thus empowering scientists to conduct and evaluate research through the review and editorial processes.
      4. To address technical concerns associated with the development of modern statistical methodology and its software implementation, as motivated by problems in food and agricultural research, including but not limited to: - Hierarchical models, including Bayesian models and generalized linear mixed models; - Meta-analyses characterized by multi-location, multi-investigator projects including those in which study treatments and/or designs may differ by location; - Big data and data science; - Interface between statistics, machine learning, and other predictive modeling strategies.
